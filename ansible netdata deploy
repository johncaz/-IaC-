Here‚Äôs a simple and effective **Ansible playbook to deploy Netdata** on Linux hosts (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).

      apt:
        name:
          - curl
          - git
          - zlib1g-dev
          - uuid-dev
          - libmnl-dev
          - gcc
          - make
          - autoconf
          - autogen
          - pkg-config
          - python3
          - python3-mysqldb
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Ensure dependencies are installed (RHEL/CentOS)
      yum:
        name:
          - curl
          - git
          - zlib-devel
          - libuuid-devel
          - libmnl-devel
          - gcc
          - make
          - autoconf
          - autogen
          - pkgconfig
          - python3
          - python3-PyMySQL
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Install Netdata using official kickstart script
      shell: bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --non-interactive
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash

    - name: Ensure Netdata is started and enabled
      systemd:
        name: netdata
        enabled: yes
        state: started
```

### üìÅ File: `inventory.ini`

```ini
[netdata_nodes]
192.168.1.100 ansible_user=ubuntu
192.168.1.101 ansible_user=ubuntu
```

---

### ‚úÖ To Run

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_netdata.yml
```

---

### üõ† Notes

- Supports both **Debian-based** and **RHEL-based** distros.
- Uses the **official Netdata kickstart script** (safe and fast).
- Adjust users, firewall, or SSH options as needed.
- You can add roles or monitoring plugins later for custom metrics.

Need a role-based version or want to deploy it with Docker? Just say the word.
